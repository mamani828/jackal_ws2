        ********************************************************************************

        versions. Please use the underscore name 'script_dir' instead.

        By 2025-Mar-03, you need to update your project and remove deprecated calls
        or your builds will no longer be supported.

        See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html for details.
